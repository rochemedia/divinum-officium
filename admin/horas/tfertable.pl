# This script contains functions to generate transfer tables for different versions of the
# Liturgical Horas, which is a set of prayers for different hours of the day. The script
# handles the reconciliation of tempora (time-based prayers) and sancti (saint-based prayers)
# for various versions and years.

# Global variables
my $a = 4;

# Subroutine to generate transfer tables for a specific version, year, and data folder
sub tfertable {
  my ($version, $kyear, $datafolder) = @_;

  # Declare package variables as global
  our $initia;
  our (%tempora, %saint);

  # Get the current month, day, and year
  my ($smonth, $say, $syear) = ($month, $day, $year);

  # Call the collect_arrays subroutine to initialize arrays and perform calculations
  collect_arrays($kyear,$datafolder);

  # ... rest of the code ...
}

# Subroutine to determine the week number for a given date
sub tfgetweek {

  # Calculate the week number based on the given date
  our @date1 = ($month, $day, $year); 
  my $a = getweek(0);
