# and the homage paid to him by foreign rulers.

# and providing for the poor and helpless.

# and rescue the children of the needy, and humble the slanderer.
71:5 et permanebit cum sole et ante lunam generationes generationum # The king's reign will endure like the sun and the moon.
71:6 descendet sicut pluvia in vellus et sicut stillicidia stillantia super terram # His blessings will flow down like rain on grass,
# and like dew on the ground.
71:7 orietur in diebus eius iustitia et abundantia pacis donec auferatur luna # During his reign, justice and peace will flourish,
# until the moon is no more.
71:8 et dominabitur a mari usque ad mare et a flumine usque ad term
