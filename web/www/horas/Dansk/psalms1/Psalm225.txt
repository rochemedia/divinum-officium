# Habakkuk's Prayer (Hab 3:2-33)

# 3:2 Lord, I have heard of your fame * and was afraid.
# 3:2 Lord, I have seen your work. * Let it be done again, before the year's end,
# 3:2 Proclaim it, before the year's end! * Do not forget your compassion, even in your anger.

# 3:3 God comes from Teman, * the Holy One from Paran's mountains.
# 3:3 His glory covers the heavens, * the earth is full of his praise;
# 3:4 His brightness is like the light, * rays flash from his hand;
# 3:4 There is where his power lies hidden. * Pestilence goes before him,
# 3:5 Fever follows in his footsteps. * Where he treads, the earth shakes;
# 3:6 Where he looks, the nations tremble. * The ancient mountains crumble,
# 3:6 The eternal hills sink low. * This is the path he has taken from ancient times.

# 3:7 The tents of Midian are torn apart, * Kush's tents fall.
# 3:8 Do you rage against the rivers, Lord? * Are you angry with the rivers, Lord, angry with the sea,
# 3:8 Since you ride on your horses, * and your chariots bring victory?
# 3:9 You take your bow and quiver, * and string your arrow on the string.
# 3:9 You split the earth to the depths, * the mountains see you and tremble,
# 3:10 The torrents of the deep roar, * the deep lifts up its waves.
# 3:11 The sun fails to shine, * the moon is put to shame;
# 3:11 They flee in terror from the light of your arrows, * from the gleam of your flashing spear.
# 3:12 In anger you march across the earth, * in fury you trample the nations.
# 3:13 You come to save your people, * to save your anointed.
# 3:13 You crush the leader's head, * and the ruler's scepter is broken.
# 3:14 You strike through the corners of the shield, * and the enemy's army is shattered.
# 3:14 They rush to scatter us, * they exult at our downfall.
# 3:15 You tread the sea with your horses, * the mighty waters foam.
# 3:16 When I heard, my body trembled, * my lips quivered at the sound;
# 3:16 Decay entered my bones, * and I trembled where I stood.
# 3:16 I waited for the day of trouble * to come upon the people who attack us.

# 3:17 Though the fig tree does not blossom, * and no fruit is on the vines,
# 3:17 Though the olive crop fails, * and the fields produce no food,
# 3:17 Though the sheep disappear from the fold, * and there is no cattle in the stalls,
# 3:18 Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, * I will exult in my God, my Savior.
# 3:19 The Lord God is my strength, * he makes my feet swift as hinds',
# 3:19 And enables me to go upon the heights * to the songs of the festive throng.
