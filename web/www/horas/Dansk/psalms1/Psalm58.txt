58:2 Protect me from my enemies, God,
    * shield me from my adversaries;
58:3 Protect me from the criminals,
    * deliver me from the murderers!
58:4 For they lay traps for me,
    * mighty men attack me,
58:5 Though I have done no wrong, nor sinned, Lord.
    * Yet I am innocent, they conspire against me.
58:6 Rise up, come yourself and see!
    * You, Lord of Hosts, God of Israel,
