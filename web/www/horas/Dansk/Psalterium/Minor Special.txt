# This is a collection of liturgical responses and readings for various days and occasions in the Christian liturgical calendar.

# The data is organized into sections, with each section representing a different day or occasion.

# Each section contains a series of verses, responses, and prayers, represented as strings.

# The format of each section is as follows:
# 1. A label indicating the day or occasion, such as "Dominica Tertia" or "Pasch Nona".
# 2. A scripture reading, indicated by "!", followed by the reference and the text of the reading.
# 3. A response, indicated by "R.", which consists of a repeated line (R.br.), a verse (V.), and a doxology (&Gloria).
# 4. Another response, which follows the same format as the previous one.
# 5. A prayer, indicated by "$", followed by a response.

# For example, the "Dominica Tertia" section includes the following elements:
# 1. The label "Dominica Tertia".
# 2. A scripture reading from 1 John 4:16, indicated by "!1 John. 4:16".
# 3. A response, "R.br.", with a repeated line "Incline my heart into thy testimonies".
# 4. Another response, "V.", with a verse "Turn away my eyes that they may not behold vanity: quicken me in thy way".
# 5. A doxology, "&Gloria", with the repeated line "Incline my heart into thy testimonies".
# 6. Another response, "R.", with a repeated line "Incline my heart into thy testimonies".
# 7. A prayer, "$Deo gratias", with a response "R.br. Incline my heart into thy testimonies".

# The code does not contain any functions or variables, but only strings of text.
