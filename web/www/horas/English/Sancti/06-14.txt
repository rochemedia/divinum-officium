# [Lectio4]
# This Basil was a noble Cappadocian v who studied earthly learning at Athens, in~
# company with Gregory of Nazianzus, to whom he was united in a warm and tender~
# friendship. He afterwards studied things sacred in a monastery, where he quickly~
# attained an eminent degree of excellence in doctrine and life, whereby he gained~
# to himself the surname of the Great. He was called to Pontus to preach the~
# Gospel of Christ Jesus, and brought back into the way of salvation that country~
# which before had been wandering astray from the rules of Christian discipline.~
# He was shortly united as coadjutor to Eusebius, Bishop of Cassarea, for the~
# edification of that city, and afterwards became his successor in the see. One of~
# his greatest labors was to maintain that the Son is of one Substance with the~
# Father, and when the Emperor Valens, moved to wrath against him, was willing to~
# send him into exile, he so bent him by dint of the miracles which he worked that~
# he forced him to forego his intention.
# This section provides a detailed biography of Basil, including his education,
# spiritual studies, and significant contributions to the Christian faith.

# [Lectio5]
# The chair upon which Valens sat down, in order to sign the decree of Basil's~
# ejectment from the city, broke down under him, and three pens which he took one~
# after the other to sign the edict of banishment, all would not write and when~
# nevertheless he remained firm to write the ungodly order, his right hand shook.~
# Valens was so frightened at these omens, that he tore the paper in two. During~
# the night which was allowed to Basil to make up his mind, Valens' wife had a~
# severe stomach-ache, and their only son was taken seriously ill. These things~
# alarmed Valens so much that he acknowledged his wickedness, and sent for Basil,~
# during whose visit the child began to get better. However, when Valens sent for~
# some heretics to see it, it presently died.
# This section describes a miraculous event in which Basil's life was spared
# through divine intervention.

# [Lectio6]
# The abstinence and self-control of Basil were truly wonderful. He was content to~
# wear nothing but one single garment. In observance of fasting he was most~
# earnest, and so instant in prayer, that he would oftentimes pass the whole night~
# therein. His virginity he kept always unsullied. He built monasteries, wherein~
# he so adapted the institution of monasticism, that he exquisitely united for the~
# inmates the advantages of the contemplative and of the active life. He was the~
# author of many learned writings, and, according to the witness of Gregory of~
# Nazianzus, no one hath ever composed more faithful and edifying explanations of~
# the books of the Holy Scripture. He died upon the 1st day of January, (in the~
# year of our Lord 379,) at which time so essentially spiritual was his life, that~
# his body showed nothing but skin and bones.
# This section highlights Basil's virtues, including his abstinence, self-control,
# fasting, prayer, and dedication to building monasteries and writing learned works.

# From the Holy Gospel according to Luke
# !Luke 14:26-35
# At that time Jesus said unto the multitudes If any man come to Me, and hate~
# not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,~
# yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. And so on.

# Homily by St. Basil, Archbishop of Caesarea.
# !Paraphrase of his Rule.
# This is perfect self-renunciation, when we attain to indifference as regards our~
# own lives, and wring from death himself the confession that our trust is not in~
# our own strength. The first step toward this crown of abnegation is to estrange~
# ourselves from outward things, such as property, public reputation, habits of~
# life, and affection for things unnecessary, whereof the immediate disciples of~
# our Holy Lord have left us a fine example James, for instance, and John, who~
# left their father Zebedee and the boats which were their only means of getting~
# their daily bread or Matthew, who got up from the receipt of custom, and~
# straightway followed the Lord.
# This section contains a homily by Basil on the Gospel of Luke, emphasizing the importance
# of self-renunciation and detachment from worldly things.

# [Lectio8]
# But what need have we for our own arguments, or for the examples of holy men to~
# confirm what we say, when we are able to cite the very words of the Lord Himself,~
