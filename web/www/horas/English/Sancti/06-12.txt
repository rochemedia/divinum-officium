His father and mother after long childlessness, obtained him from God by prayers and good works. From his earliest years he gave clear signs of his after holiness of life. He was used to climb up upon an high place to preach to the other little boys, and to exhort them to be good and to worship God, and he made it his work to reconcile their quarrels. While he was still at home he was given in charge to the monks of the Order of Saint Benedict, at the village of San Fagondez, to teach him his first lessons. While he was thus busied, his father obtained for him the benefice of the Parish, but no persuasions could induce him to keep this preferment. He became one of the household of the Bishop of Burgos, and that Prelate, seeing his uprightness, took him into his counsels, ordained him Priest, and made him a Canon, heaping upon him many kindnesses. However, that he might serve God the more quietly, he left the Bishop's Palace, resigned all his Church income, and betook him to a certain Chapel wherein he celebrated the Holy Liturgy every day, and oftentimes preached concerning the things of God, with great profit to all that heard him."

Here he had a severe illness, and vowed to take up a sterner way of living. In fulfillment of this vow, he gave to an half-naked beggar the better of the two garments which were all that he had, and then went to a Convent of the friars of St. Augustine, which was then in the richest bloom of rigid discipline. Being admitted therein, he surpassed the most advanced in obedience, lowliness, watchings, and prayer. At the time that he had charge of the table, one keg of wine abundantly sufficed in his hands for all the friars, throughout an whole year. After his year of novitiate, he undertook the duty of preacher at the command of his Superior. At that time, owing to bloody feuds, all things human and divine at Salamanca were in such utter confusion, that murders were committed almost every hour, and the streets and squares, and the very churches, flowed with the blood of all classes, especially of the nobility."
