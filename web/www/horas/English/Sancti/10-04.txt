# [Lectio4] - This section describes St. Francis's early life and his turning away from material possessions.
# Francis was born at Assisi in Umbria, (in the year of our Lord 11 82.) From his~
# early youth he followed the example of his father, (Peter Bernardone,) and~
# busied himself with merchandise. It befell one day that, contrary to his~
# usage, he had thrust from him a beggar, who cried for money for Christ's sake, when,~
# being cut to the heart with regret, he gave him large alms, and promised to God~
# from that day forth never to deny to any that asked of him. He fell after this~
# into a grievous sickness, and from the time that he was healed thereof, he gave~
# himself more earnestly to works of love for his neighbour. At length he became~
# fain in this sort to be perfect, even as the Lord hath said in the Gospel,~
# ~(Matth. xix. 21,) and gave to the poor whatsoever he had. His father would not~
# have it so, and brought him before the Bishop of Assisi, that he might renounce~
# all right to any inheritance. He cheerfully gave up all to his father, even to~
# his clothes, telling them that now he should be able with more utter dependence~
# to say Our Father, Who art in heaven.

# [Lectio5] - This section describes St. Francis's founding of the Order of Friars Minor and his desire for martyrdom.
# Upon the 24th day of February, in the year 1209,) he heard read the words of~
# the Gospel Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor scrip~
# for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes. (Matth. x. 9, 10.) Thereupon~
# he determined that that should be his rule of living. He took off his shoes, and~
# contented himself with one coat. When he had gathered twelve comrades, he~
# founded the Order of Friars Minor. He went to Rome in the (same) year, to get~
# from the Apostolic See a confirmation of his Order. When he came Pope Innocent~
# III. thrust him away. Thereafter he dreamt that he saw the Church of the most~
# Holy Saviour falling, and whom he had cast forth bearing it up with his~
# shoulders. He bade therefore that he should be sought for and brought again~
# before him, welcomed him kindly, and approved all the Rule which he had~
# established. Francis therefore sent his Friars into all quarters of the world to~
# preach the Gospel of Christ. He himself was fain to find some occasion of~
# martyrdom, and therefore made a voyage into Syria, (in the year 1219,) but the~
# Sultan treated him with the greatest kindness, offering him many gifts, and,~
# since he could do no good, he returned again to Italy.

# [Lectio6] - This section describes St. Francis's reception of the stigmata and his death.
# Towards the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, (in the year~
# 1224), when there had already been built many houses of Friars of his Order, he~
# withdrew himself into a most secret place upon Mount Alverno, and began to fast~
# for forty days in honour of the holy Archangel Michael. Upon the Feast-day of~
# the Uplifting of the Holy Cross, (as he was praying upon the side of the~
# mountain,) he saw a vision of a crucified Seraph, which left in his hands and~
# feet holes with nails therein, and in his side a great wound. Holy BuonaVentura~
# hath left it in writing that he once heard Pope Alexander IV., when preaching,~
# testify that he had himself seen these marks. It was a sign of such love of~
# Christ toward him as stirred up the great wonder of all men. Two years~
# thereafter he fell sick unto death, and was fain to be carried into the Church~
# of St. Mary-of-the-Angels, that he might give up the breath of life in the same~
# place where God had breathed into him the breath of the life of grace. Being~
# there (laid on the earth, sprinkled with ashes, and covered with an old habit,)~
# he exhorted the Friars to poverty, patience and the~
# preservation of the faith of the holy Roman
