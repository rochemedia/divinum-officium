# This code block describes the feast day of various saints and martyrs

# The feast of holy Stephen, King of Hungary, is celebrated on September 2nd.
# Stephen was the first Hungarian to convert to Christianity and was received
# into heaven by the Virgin Mary on the day of her Assumption.
# His feast day was moved from August 16th to September 2nd by Pope Innocent XI.
# This date was chosen because it was the day the Christian army, with Stephen's
# help, recaptured the fortress of Buda from the Turks.
